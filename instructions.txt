To start the server, open up a terminal and run the command: node server.js

 in a separate terminal, run the curl command with URL+endpoint+query parameters to see the weather data returned in JSON format.

 Ex for SF: curl "localhost:8080/weather_microservice?lat=37.7749&lon=122.4194"

 should receive a JSON object with the weather data for San Francisco, ex: {"description":"Clouds","temperature":32,"icon":"04d"}

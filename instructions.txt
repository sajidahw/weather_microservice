**** to run manually in terminal ****
To start the server, open up a terminal and run the command: node server.js

 in a separate terminal, run the curl command with URL+endpoint+query parameters to see the weather data returned in JSON format.

 Ex for SF: curl "localhost:8080/weather_microservice?lat=37.7749&lon=122.4194"

 should receive a JSON object with the weather data for San Francisco, ex: {"description":"Clouds","temperature":32,"icon":"04d"}


 *** to use testing script***
 Open up two terminals.
 In first terminal, type node server.js to run the microservice
 In second terminal, type node testWeather.js to run the test script which prompts requesting and retrieving basic weather info for several geo coordinates.
